# Quick Modern Object Pascal for Programmers

An introduction to modern Object Pascal. May be useful for programmers that already know the concepts (like "class"), but don't know how these concepts look in Object Pascal.

Contains some introductory material at the beginning, and at the end quickly jumps over more advanced topics like class references. Enjoy, and share and redistribute freely!
